# Code Challenge: Class 05: Linked List Implementation  


- [x] Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

- [x] Create a Linked List class
- [x] Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
- [x] Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.   


* The class should contain the following methods
- [x] insert
      Arguments: value
      Returns: nothing
      Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
- [x] includes
      Arguments: value
      Returns: Boolean
      Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
- [x] to string
      Arguments: none
      Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"   -


* testing

- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- [x] Can properly insert into the linked list
- [x] The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- [x] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- [x] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- [x] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- [x] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
